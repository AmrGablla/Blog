## How to debug other packges or check edits

After a year of working with open-source repositories, I face a lot of times a situation in which I need to make a quick edit in the library and check the result before going through the PRs cycle. Hence, I found this excellent and dangerous command:

``` js
  npm link 
```

### What

### When

- You might be the author of a dependency and donâ€™t have good test coverage yet
- Check issue or bug in dependency

### How

- use the symbolic link

### what is the differnece between npm link and npx link

1- npx is cli tool to install and manage dependencies or to execute it
